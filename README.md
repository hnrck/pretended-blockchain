## 1. In a nutshell
### 1.1. About
This project is a **toy blockchain** built in Haskell. It is as simple as possible, and has scope for improvement. For instance, instead of having a single transaction in a block, set of transactions will be used in a future version, and a Merkle tree later on.

For now, a *blockchain* is a chain of *blocks*, comprised of a *header* and *transactions*.

In this version, certain limitations have been set, so the project remains simple:
- *Logical times* are used for the timestamp in the header
- A *transaction* is a contract from someone to someone else, involving a certain amount of something.
- The *blockchain* is local.
- The *blockchain* routine exists in the Main, and the user interacts with the blockchain through the terminal.
- No *proof-of-work*, or whatever. No NONCE.

### 1.2. Usage
The project uses stack. The following commands are useful to understand the project implementation.

This project has been tested with Linux and Windows.

#### 1.2.1. Cloning this repo
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hnrck/pretended-blockchain
$ git checkout tags/0.1.0.0
```

#### 1.2.2. Testing the implementation
```bash
$ stack test
```
Please feel free to report problems with your tests.

#### 1.2.3. Generating the documentation
```bash
$ stack haddock --open
```
The documentation will be opened in a browser. The documentation of the project is located in the Blockchain section.

#### 1.2.4. Building and executing the project
```bash
$ stack build
$ stack exec PretendedBlockchain
```
Once executed, the terminal can be used to add transactions in the blockchain.

## 2. Related work
Multiple Haskell projects on implementing a blockchain exist, especially on GitHub :octocat:. They are all very impressive and much more explained than mine.

Here is a selection:

- [MichaelBurge/haskoin](https://github.com/MichaelBurge/haskoin) -- A POC blockchain in Haskell, with a [detailed article](http://www.michaelburge.us/2017/08/17/rolling-your-own-blockchain.html) on his blog.
- [aviaviavi/legion](https://github.com/aviaviavi/legion) -- Another blockchain written in Haskell, inspired by naivechain.
- [adjoint-io/nanochain](https://github.com/adjoint-io/nanochain) -- A blockchain written in Haskell, with proof-of-work. A [dedicated website](https://www.adjoint.io/) is available.

## 4. Data types
### 4.1. The blockchain
The blockchain is a simple *chain* of *blocks*. Nevertheless, in the usage, the blockchain is put in a StateT monad.
```haskell
type Blockchain = [Block]
```
![PretendedBlockchain illustration](/images/blockchain.png)

### 4.2. A block
The blockchain's block. A block can be printed or tested for equality. The header is computed at creation, and the transaction is not mandatory.

```haskell
data Block = Block
  { header      :: Header
  , transaction :: Maybe Transaction
  } deriving (Show, Eq)
```

### 4.3. The header
Containing the previous hash, timestamp, and current hash, computed at block creation.
```haskell
data Header = Header
  { previousHash :: ByteString
  , timestamp    :: !LogicalTime
  , hash         :: ByteString
  } deriving (Show, Eq)
```

### 4.4. A transaction
A transaction is a contract from someone to someone else, of a certain amount.
```haskell
data Transaction = Transaction
  { from   :: String
  , to     :: String
  , amount :: Float
  } deriving (Show, Eq)

```
